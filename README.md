## My process

### Built with
- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid

### What I learned

In this project, I implemented CSS Grid for the very first time, and honestly â€” it was incredibly fun and satisfying to work with. Grid made it super flexible to structure a complex layout while keeping everything clean and easy to manage. It allowed me to precisely position each card and maintain consistency, especially when scaling up to the desktop view.

I also used a mobile-first approach when writing the CSS, and it really paid off. By starting with the smallest screen size and progressively enhancing the layout, I was able to ensure a fully responsive design that looks great on all devices â€” from mobile phones to large desktop screens.

Highlights:

âœ… Mobile-first development: Built the layout starting from mobile, ensuring maximum responsiveness.

âœ… First-time use of CSS Grid: Creating the 4-card layout with Grid was efficient, clean, and super enjoyable!

âœ… Custom properties (CSS variables): Helped maintain consistent colors, fonts, and spacing throughout the project.

âœ… Clean typography: Used the Poppins font family with different weights to reinforce visual hierarchy.

Overall, this project gave me valuable hands-on experience in building a responsive, modern, and well-structured layout using new, powerful techniques.


### Useful resources

- [Jasoneczek's Profile on Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/jasoneczek) - This profile helped me out to know the exact size of the card and padding because my FE Mentor Member is not premium so I dont get the figma file and dont know the exact size and the Jasoneczek's profile helps me alot.
